### ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I'm a full stack engineer with a penchant for type systems, scalable state management, and effective documentation. Talk to me about using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), your favorite tea to pair [boba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea), or whether or not there's a [pipeline problem](http://isitapipelineproblem.com/) in tech.
